## Experience

### Skills
- Business Analysis consulting. 
A key element for successful and reliable app is quality requirements. If you‚Äôre starting the app from scratch, with only business need or an idea, I can help you with requirement elicitation as well as creating specification and adjusting it for changing conditions.
- Technical solutions investigations. 
Mobile developers nowadays can rely on a huge toolkit of solutions that can be easily integrated into an app. Machine learning, AR, IoT, GPU computation provide great power that previously was only available for desktops and servers.
- Architecture development. 
Every business needs to react to the changing conditions fast and efficiently, so needs its app. Well-thought out architecture depends on technical nuances of specific app as well as on requirements it meets. That helps to make incremental changes efficiently and prevent losses in codebase quality.
- Native-oriented app development. 
Built-in iOS frameworks can solve a wide range of technical tasks while keeping code optimized and easy to maintain in future. Years of freelance development helped me to collect a number of tested solutions for features the typical apps may need. 

### Freelance
Being a self-employed developer helped me to increase working efficiency and attentiveness. My top priority is achieving predictable result in terms of time and quality.

### Full time employment
I had been working as a full-time developer from 2015 to 2018. Being a part of large distributed teams helped me to gain both communication skills and ability to write easy to read and mantain code with industrial degree of quality.

### Analysis Experience
Four years of business analysis experience allowed me to participate in all major BA activities: requirement elicitation and management, domain analysis in both complex corporate systems and agile-managed startups.

## Education
BSU, Faculty in Mechanics and Math. Specialization: Mathematician, System Analyst. "Requirements Management" graduation paper.
